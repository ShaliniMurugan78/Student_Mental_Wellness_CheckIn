# Student_Mental_Wellness_CheckIn

I designed and developed a complete Student Mental Wellness Check-In application during my hands-on build experience with the Adya AI platform.

The goal was simple but meaningful — create a safe, calming digital space where students can regularly track their emotions, reflect on their thoughts, and build healthier mental habits.

Instead of just building another dashboard, I focused on crafting a beautiful, supportive, and interactive experience.

🌿 Key Features

• Daily mood & stress check-ins
• Emotion tracking with visual analytics (charts + trends)
• Personal journal with local storage
• Gamified “Wellness Garden” that grows with streaks 🌱
• Breathing exercises & self-care tips
• Rule-based AI chat companion for gentle support
• Fully frontend + privacy-first (no data leaves the device)
