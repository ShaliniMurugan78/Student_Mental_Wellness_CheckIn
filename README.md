# Student_Mental_Wellness_CheckIn

I designed and developed a complete Student Mental Wellness Check-In application during my hands-on build experience with the Adya AI platform.

The goal was simple but meaningful — create a safe, calming digital space where students can regularly track their emotions, reflect on their thoughts, and build healthier mental habits.

Instead of just building another dashboard, I focused on crafting a beautiful, supportive, and interactive experience.

🌿 Key Features

• Daily mood & stress check-ins
• Emotion tracking with visual analytics (charts + trends)
• Personal journal with local storage
• Gamified “Wellness Garden” that grows with streaks 🌱
• Breathing exercises & self-care tips
• Rule-based AI chat companion for gentle support
• Fully frontend + privacy-first (no data leaves the device)

My Learning Journey with Adya

Working on Adya AI was a great hands-on experience where I:
• Rapidly prototyped full-stack-like apps with frontend-only architecture
• Learned real-world debugging & build workflows
• Optimized features to run efficiently with minimal cloud usage
• Practiced transforming ideas → UI → working product
• Explored deployment concepts using Google Cloud

It felt less like a tutorial and more like building an actual product from scratch.
